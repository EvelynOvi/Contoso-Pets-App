## Summary

The goal was to build an application that implements a combination of selection and iteration statements to achieve the design goals of the application.

By creating nested combinations of iteration and selection statements, the application has a user interface that enables the user to display pet data from the ourAnimals array. It also has features to enter and validate characteristics of new pets and add them to the ourAnimals array. The app user can continue making menu selections until they choose to exit the application.
