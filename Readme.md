## Summary

The goal was to build an application that implements a combination of selection and iteration statements to achieve the design goals of the application.

By creating nested combinations of iteration and selection statements, the application has a user interface that enables the user to display pet data from the ourAnimals array. It also has features to enter and validate characteristics of new pets and add them to the ourAnimals array. The app user can continue making menu selections until they choose to exit the application.

## Exercise - Build sample data and menu selection loops

The tasks that you complete during this exercise are:

1. Code review: review the contents of the Program.cs file
2. Sample data: convert the if-elseif-else structure to switch-case structure that improves readability.
3. Menu loop: enclose the main menu and menu item selection in a loop that iterates until the user enters "exit".
4. Menu selections: write the code for a switch-case structure that establishes separate code branches for each menu option.
5. Code branches: write placeholder within the menu item branches that provides user feedback until app features are developed.
6. Verification test: perform verification tests for the code that you develop in this exercise.
