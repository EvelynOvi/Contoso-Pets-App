# Exercise - Build sample data and menu selection loops

The tasks that you complete during this exercise are:

1. Code review: review the contents of the Program.cs file
2. Sample data: convert the if-elseif-else structure to switch-case structure that improves readability.
3. Menu loop: enclose the main menu and menu item selection in a loop that iterates until the user enters "exit".
4. Menu selections: write the code for a switch-case structure that establishes separate code branches for each menu option.
5. Code branches: write placeholder within the menu item branches that provides user feedback until app features are developed.
6. Verification test: perform verification tests for the code that you develop in this exercise.
